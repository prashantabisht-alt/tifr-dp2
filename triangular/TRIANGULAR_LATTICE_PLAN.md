# Triangular Lattice Active Random Walker — research plan after PI meeting

**Meeting date:** 2026-05-04 (Mon)  ·  **Today:** 2026-05-11 (Mon)  ·  **Deadline:** Fri 2026-05-15
**PI:** Kabir Ramola
**Recording:** transcribed from Apple Watch
**Last revised:** 2026-05-11 evening, after web-search + Mathematica audit

**Strategic note (from PI lesson learned):** show small results frequently, not one big dump. Each working-day target = one figure or one result PI can absorb in 2 minutes. Friday is the soft deadline for first band-structure result.

## 1. What PI actually asked for — two separate tracks

**Critical framing point (corrected 2026-05-11 after review):** PI mentioned both TCRW (the paper you reproduced) and his own JMVR / Confinement-draft work. **These are two different models with two different chirality conventions.** Don't merge them. Do JMVR first (it's his group's model, has an unfinished paper); only attempt TCRW-on-triangular separately, after the JMVR triangular pass works.

### Track A — Triangular JMVR (THIS WEEK; PRIMARY)
Reproduce/finish Kabir-Dipanjan's triangular active random walker. This is the **Confinement 2021 draft §IV.B** (currently empty). Specifically:
- 6 directors (one per NN lattice direction); CTRW dynamics.
- Hopping rate: $\frac{1}{6} \pm \epsilon$ along the director's forward/backward axis, $\frac{1}{6}$ to the other 4 NN. (Translation chirality, controlled by $\epsilon$.)
- Director switching at rate $\gamma/2$ to each of the two adjacent directors (no chirality in rotation).
- 6×6 Bloch matrix $M(\mathbf{k})$.
- **Match equations to the Confinement draft**, verify against Dipanjan's `rtp_tl_2.nb`.
- **Diagnose** the old theory-vs-MC mismatch Kabir mentioned ("I think he implemented the boundary conditions wrong").
- Single-walker first. Then maybe multi-walker non-monotonic clustering in 2D (the draft's §V, also empty).

### Track B — Triangular TCRW (SECONDARY, only if Track A finishes early)
Same Osat–Speck rules you reproduced on square, but on triangular. Distinct from Track A: chirality is in the **rotation** (CW vs CCW with bias $\omega$), not in translation.
- 6 directors, $\omega \in [0, 1]$ rotation chirality parameter, $D_r$ noise rate.
- 6×6 Bloch matrix $P(\mathbf{k})$ with phases on chiral entries.
- Does the topology survive 4-fold → 6-fold? Does the gap still close at $\omega = 1/2$?
- This is the **research-question side** of PI's ask: whether the topological story from TCRW generalizes.

### Task C — Topological invariant question (when Track A or B gives a non-trivial spectrum)
PI explicitly admitted he's not sure of the answer:
> "Yeh aapko padhna padega. Berry curvature, wahan se integral leke aapko milega. As soon as you have this flat bands, there is something known as topological invariant... This is a question I don't honestly know."

Compute the **Chern number** (when TR-symmetry is broken, i.e. $\epsilon \neq 0$ in JMVR or $\omega \neq 1/2$ in TCRW) **OR the 2D Zak phase** (when TR-symmetric). See §3.6 for the recipe.

### Task D — Multi-particle interactions (LATER, NOT NOW)
Connection to:
- **Surajit Chakraborty's PhD work** (just finishing) — multi-particle chiral walkers with friction
- **Odd elasticity (Scheibner–Cohen–Vitelli)** — chirality becomes physically interesting once particles interact
- **Topological mechanics** (Kane & Lubensky line of work) — exploratory, "I'm not 100% sure it will be of interest"

PI was explicit: *"abhi ke liye triangular lattice karo"* — for now, just do triangular. Multi-particle is the next chapter.

## 2. Context PI revealed (things I didn't know before)

### 2.1 The JMVR paper is the home reference, not TCRW

**Confirmed citation (web-searched 2026-05-11):**
**Jose S., Mandal D., Barma M., Ramola K.** — *"Active Random Walks in One and Two Dimensions"* — Phys. Rev. E **105**, 064103 (2022) — arXiv:[2202.02995](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02995).

> **Note:** Kabir said "Jose, Mandal, *Verma*, Ramola" during the meeting. The actual co-author is **Mustansir Barma** (TIFR Hyderabad senior physicist), not Verma. Easy mishearing; use the correct citation in any write-up.

The JMVR model:
- **Continuous-time random walker (CTRW)** on a 1D or 2D lattice.
- Walker carries an internal "state" (1D: $\pm$; 2D triangular: 6 directors aligned with NN directions).
- **Translation rates** (per direction) — taking 1D as the canonical case from the Confinement draft Eq. (1):
  - Walker in state +: hops in +x at rate $\frac{1}{2} + \epsilon$, in −x at rate $\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon$.
  - Walker in state −: rates swapped.
  - For 6-direction triangular (Confinement draft §IV.B): per-direction baseline rate is $\frac{1}{6}$, with $\pm \epsilon$ bias along the director's forward/backward axis. Sideways hops are unbiased at rate $\frac{1}{6}$.
- **State-switching rate** $\gamma$: this is the orientation-flip rate (1D: $\pm \to \mp$; 2D triangular: $d \to d \pm 1$ mod 6 at rate $\gamma/2$ to each). $\gamma$ is **NOT** the translation baseline — it's the rotation rate.
- **Output**: exact occupation probabilities $P(x, t)$ via inverse Fourier; large-deviation free energy in the continuum limit.

> **What JMVR did NOT do:** topological edge modes or non-Hermitian band topology. That's the TCRW paper's contribution. JMVR is exact stochastic statistical mechanics; TCRW is non-Hermitian topology. Don't conflate them.

> "We were the first people to define this model... in both directions equally, gamma, gamma, gamma/2 forward and backward. When you break it, you go in this direction more and you go in this direction less." — PI was using approximate shorthand; the actual rates are 1/2 ± ε per direction in 1D (or 1/6 ± ε for triangular forward/backward), not γ/2 ± ε.

**Important:** Kabir's group's mental model is JMVR, not TCRW. The TCRW reproduction was a test. **The triangular work should be framed as "JMVR-extended-to-triangular" first, with TCRW as a parallel topology-side calculation.**

### 2.2 They previously tried triangular (Dipanjan, 2019) — never published
PI's draft notes + Mathematica code from **Dipanjan Mandal** (Sep 2019):
> "Yeh paper humne kabhi likha nahi... I think he implemented the boundary conditions wrong. That's what I'm trying to figure out."

So this is **an actual open project in the group**, not just a textbook exercise. There's a real chance you can finish what Dipanjan started and turn it into a paper.

**The Mathematica file `rtp_tl_2.nb` — audited 2026-05-11:**

Parameters at top of file:
- `gamma = 0.01` — rotation rate (γ/2 between adjacent directors)
- `epsilon = 0.15` — **chirality parameter** (forward/backward translation bias)
- `a = 1, b = 1` — lattice constants
- `L = 30` — finite grid size for any real-space work

The 6×6 Bloch matrix `mat[k1, k2]`:
- **Off-diagonal entries = γ/2** at positions $(i, i\pm 1) \mod 6$ — these are director-switching rates (orientational diffusion, symmetric).
- **Diagonal entries** `coeff_i(k1, k2)` for i=1,2,3 and `Conjugate(coeff_i)` for the opposite directors:
$$
\text{coeff}_i = \frac{1}{3}\Big(\cos(2 a k_1) + \cos(a k_1 + b k_2) + \cos(a k_1 - b k_2)\Big) - 1 - \gamma + 2 i \epsilon \sin(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_i)
$$
where $\hat{e}_1 = (2a, 0)$, $\hat{e}_2 = (a, b)$, $\hat{e}_3 = (a, -b)$.

Reading it row-by-row (corrected after review 2026-05-11):
- **The walker in any director hops to all 6 NN.** The $(1/3) \cdot (3 \text{ cosines})$ structure is exactly $(1/6) \cdot (6 \text{ cosines})$, with each $\cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_d) + \cos(-\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_d) = 2 \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_d)$ paired together → 3 distinct cosine terms with prefactor $1/3$. So each director hops symmetrically to all 6 NN with baseline rate $1/6$.
- **Chirality** enters as an imaginary $i \epsilon \sin(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_d)$ term — this is the translation bias along director $d$'s axis: $1/6 + \epsilon$ forward, $1/6 - \epsilon$ backward. The other 4 NN remain at rate $1/6$.
- Chirality is in **translation rates**, NOT in rotation rates. (Distinguishes from TCRW.)
- At $\mathbf{k} = 0$ the column sums vanish (probability conservation for a CTRW generator): $\text{coeff}|_{\mathbf{k}=0} = 1 - 1 - \gamma = -\gamma$ balanced by the two off-diagonal $\gamma/2$ entries summing to $\gamma$. **This is a generator condition, not column-stochasticity** — for continuous-time Markov chains, the condition is column sums = 0, not column sums = 1 (column sums = 1 is for discrete-time chains).

**Two possible issues I identified — now revised:**

1. **Lattice parametrization (likely not a bug).** With `a = b = 1`, the NN vectors $(2a, 0), (a, b), (a, -b)$ have lengths $2, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}$ — **not isotropic in Cartesian**. But this is a **deliberate algebraic parametrization** (matches the Confinement draft Fig 1 explicitly), not a geometric mistake. For a true 60°-isotropic triangular metric, use $b = \sqrt{3}\, a$; for the Confinement-draft convention, use $a = b$. The two are related by an affine reparametrization that preserves all topological invariants. **The original "this is a bug" hypothesis was wrong; this is just convention.**

2. **PBC asymmetry in Fourier wavevectors.** Dipanjan defines $k_x[n] = 2\pi n/(2aL)$ and $k_y[n] = 2\pi n/(bL)$ — the x-period is doubled relative to y. **This is the correct BZ for the chosen parametrization** (the lattice vectors $(2a, 0)$ and $(a, b)$ span a parallelogram with that exact reciprocal). Probably NOT the bug Kabir flagged. **Need to look at the real-space PBC implementation to find the actual bug** — the Bloch part looks self-consistent.

### 2.3 The PBC trap on triangular
PI drew the geometry explicitly and walked through the trap:

Using Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$, with primitive vectors $\mathbf{a}_1 = (1, 0)$ and $\mathbf{a}_2 = (1/2, \sqrt{3}/2)$ (so $\mathbf{a}_2$ at 60° from $\mathbf{a}_1$):

- **Periodicity along $\mathbf{a}_1$ (n1-axis):** trivial. $x \to x \mod L$.
- **Periodicity along $\mathbf{a}_2$ (n2-axis):** NOT trivial. If the walker crosses the n2-boundary, you wrap $y$ by the period of the lattice along $\mathbf{a}_2$, AND you also shift $x$ by $-L/2$. Quoting PI from his notes:
$$
\text{along } \hat{n}_1: \quad (x + L) \mod L = \tilde{x}
$$
$$
\text{along } \hat{n}_2: \quad (y + L) \mod L = \tilde{y}, \quad \tilde{x} = x - L/2
$$

This is the **standard skew-PBC for triangular/hexagonal lattices** — well known but easy to get wrong if you naively copy the square-lattice modular arithmetic.

**Simpler implementation:** parametrize sites by integer lattice coordinates $(m, n)$ where site position is $m \mathbf{a}_1 + n \mathbf{a}_2$. Then PBC is trivially $(m, n) \equiv (m + L, n) \equiv (m, n + L)$. Convert to Cartesian only for plotting. **This is what I'd recommend** to avoid the trap entirely.

### 2.4 PI doesn't fully grok the topological argument
> "I am not sure ki kya ho raha hai. But that is our theoretical calculation."

Explicit admission. So when you compute the Berry curvature / Zak phase for triangular, **you'll be teaching him**, not the other way around. This is good — it's a real research contribution rather than running someone else's recipe.

### 2.5 Anshuman is a resource for triangular-lattice PBC
> "You can ask Anshuman. He does triangular lattice all the time."

Probably Anshuman Pandey or another group member. Has correct PBC code already running. **Use him**, especially when implementing the lattice mod arithmetic.

## 3. The model on triangular lattice (math setup)

### 3.1 Two distinct chirality conventions — DECIDE FIRST

This is the most important conceptual point. There are **two physically different chiral active walker models on triangular**, and they need to be kept separate:

| Model | Chirality lives in | Parameter | Bloch matrix structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JMVR** (Jose-Mandal-Barma-Ramola, Dipanjan's Mathematica) | **Translation rates** (forward ≠ backward) | $\epsilon$ | Off-diagonal γ/2 (symmetric rotations); diagonal has $i \epsilon \sin(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e})$ chirality term |
| **TCRW** (Osat-Speck, the paper you reproduced) | **Rotation rates** (CW ≠ CCW) | $\omega$ | Off-diagonal phases $e^{\pm i \mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}}$ on chiral entries; entire entries weighted by ω vs 1−ω |

**These are NOT the same model.** Both have edge currents and non-Hermitian Bloch matrices, but the topology, gap-closure conditions, and edge-mode physics may differ.

**My recommendation:** start with **JMVR-style** (matches Dipanjan's setup, matches Kabir's group's mental model, gives a direct comparison to the old Mathematica). Add TCRW-style as a second variant only if there's time / interest.

### 3.2 JMVR on triangular — the lattice setup

6 nearest-neighbor directions:
$$
\hat{e}_d = (\cos(d\pi/3),\ \sin(d\pi/3)), \quad d = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
$$
(or, equivalently, Dipanjan's parametrization with $(2a, 0), (a, b), (a, -b)$ and conjugates — see §2.2; either gives equivalent topology).

**Director-switching (rotation) rules — symmetric, no chirality:**
- $d \to (d + 1) \mod 6$ at rate $\gamma/2$
- $d \to (d - 1) \mod 6$ at rate $\gamma/2$
- Total rotation rate per state: $\gamma$. $\gamma$ is the **orientation-switching rate**, nothing else.

**Translation rates — biased along director's axis:**
- Walker in director $d$ hops to all 6 NN.
- Rate to NN in direction $+\hat{e}_d$ (forward): $\tfrac{1}{6} + \epsilon$
- Rate to NN in direction $-\hat{e}_d$ (backward): $\tfrac{1}{6} - \epsilon$
- Rate to other 4 NN (sideways): $\tfrac{1}{6}$ each
- Total translation rate per state: $\tfrac{4}{6} + (\tfrac{1}{6} + \epsilon) + (\tfrac{1}{6} - \epsilon) = 1$
- Achiral case: $\epsilon = 0$ → uniform 1/6 to all 6 NN, walker is a symmetric random walker.

**This is the rate convention to verify against Confinement draft Eq. (1) and §IV.B before writing any code.** The 1D version of the draft uses $\frac{1}{2} \pm \epsilon$ (the 2-direction analog of the 6-direction $\frac{1}{6} \pm \epsilon$).

**Total outgoing rate per state** = (translation total) + (rotation total) = $1 + \gamma$. The generator's diagonal then has $-(1 + \gamma)$ at $\mathbf{k} = 0$ minus the rotation-rate contribution (already accounted for via the off-diagonal $\gamma/2$ terms).

### 3.3 Bloch matrix $M(\mathbf{k})$ — 6×6 generator

The CTRW generator at momentum $\mathbf{k}$:
- **Off-diagonal entries**: rotation rates $\gamma/2$ at positions $(d, d \pm 1) \mod 6$.
- **Diagonal entries**: $-[\text{total outgoing rate}] + [\text{hopping in Fourier}]$, with the chirality $i \epsilon \sin(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e}_d)$ term.

This is exactly Dipanjan's structure but with the lattice geometry corrected (if his $a = b = 1$ was wrong).

### 3.4 Symmetries to expect

**Square (4-fold) → triangular (6-fold)** changes the symmetry group. Expect:
- **C_6 cyclic** symmetry: rotation of all directors by one step ($d \to d+1$) plus rotation of $\mathbf{k}$ by 60° leaves the matrix invariant.
- **Inversion** ($\mathbf{k} \to -\mathbf{k}$): combined with director reflection.
- The square TCRW had a **chiral / sublattice symmetry** giving $\pm \lambda$ eigenvalue pairs. Whether this survives on triangular is **an open question** — it depends on the bipartite-ness of the rotation graph, which is **6-cycle = bipartite!** (6 is even, so the cycle is 2-colorable: alternating directors form two sets of 3). So chiral symmetry may survive. **Worth checking analytically once you have the matrix.**

### 3.5 Gap closure: does it stay at the achiral limit?

In JMVR, the achiral limit is $\epsilon = 0$. At that point, the matrix is real (no imaginary terms in the diagonal), the spectrum becomes manifestly Hermitian, and any gap closure can only be a regular band crossing.

When you turn on $\epsilon > 0$, the imaginary $i \epsilon \sin(...)$ terms break Hermiticity and the spectrum can move into the complex plane. **The first concrete numerical question is: at $\epsilon = 0$ do bands cross, and how does the structure of those crossings change as $\epsilon$ grows?**

This is conceptually different from TCRW (where the gap closes at $\omega = 1/2$ because that's where rotation chirality vanishes). The JMVR "gap closure" condition will involve $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$ in some other combination.

---

### 3.6 Topological invariants — what to compute and how

PI explicitly raised this question at the meeting (*"Berry curvature... topological invariant... I don't honestly know"*). This subsection is the bulletproof reference for when you get to Day 5+.

#### 3.6.1 Three objects, NOT one — keep them straight

| Object | Symbol | Gauge-invariant? | Topological? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Berry **connection** | $\mathbf{A}_n(\mathbf{k}) = i \langle u_n(\mathbf{k}) \vert \nabla_\mathbf{k} \vert u_n(\mathbf{k})\rangle$ | NO | NO |
| Berry **curvature** | $\Omega_n(\mathbf{k}) = \nabla_\mathbf{k} \times \mathbf{A}_n(\mathbf{k})$ (z-component in 2D) | YES | NO — smooth field |
| Topological **invariant** | e.g. Chern number $C_n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\rm BZ} \Omega_n\, d^2k$ | YES | YES — integer |

**Common confusion (answer for PI):** "Berry curvature" alone is **not** a topological invariant. Its **integral over a closed manifold** (the BZ torus in 2D) IS. The invariant is what's quantized; the curvature is the integrand.

#### 3.6.2 Which invariant does our model have?

Depends on symmetries. Two candidate invariants:

| Invariant | When non-trivial | Computed via |
|---|---|---|
| **Chern number** $C_n$ | Time-reversal broken | FHS plaquette algorithm — see §3.6.4 |
| **2D Zak phase / Wilson loop** $\theta_n$ | Inversion / chiral / sublattice symmetry preserved | Path-ordered Berry connection along 1D loops — see §3.6.5 |

**JMVR on triangular (Track A):**
- At $\epsilon = 0$ (achiral): the generator is real and symmetric → Hermitian. C = 0 trivially. Zak phase may still be non-trivial (similar to SSH-like systems).
- At $\epsilon > 0$ (chiral): the $i \epsilon \sin(\mathbf{k} \cdot \hat{e})$ term makes $M$ non-Hermitian. Under $\mathbf{k} \to -\mathbf{k}$, the matrix satisfies $M(-\mathbf{k}) = M(\mathbf{k})^*$ — a TR$^+$-like anti-unitary symmetry. **Whether this constrains the Chern number is a representation-class question** (Bernard–LeClair / Kawabata classification of non-Hermitian topology). Don't assume C = 0; compute it.

**Track A is primarily about exact stat-mech ($P(\mathbf{r}, t)$, clustering), not topology.** The topology question may not have an interesting answer for JMVR specifically. If you want non-trivial topology, **Track B (TCRW-style chirality on triangular) is the more promising direction** — TCRW on square already has a non-trivial 2D Zak phase, and the triangular extension is where PI's research question lives.

**Compute Chern and Zak phase on both Track A and Track B** when you reach the topology phase of the project. Sequence: Track A finished cleanly → Track B matrix built → compute topology on Track B (TCRW-style) first, since that's where it's most likely interesting.

#### 3.6.3 Non-Hermitian biorthogonal subtlety

JMVR's generator $M(\mathbf{k})$ is non-Hermitian: $M^\dagger \neq M$ because of the $i \epsilon \sin$ term. So $|u_n^R\rangle$ (right eigenvector) and $|u_n^L\rangle$ (left eigenvector, eigenvector of $M^\dagger$) are different.

The correct gauge-invariant Berry connection uses the **biorthogonal pair**:
$$
\mathbf{A}_n(\mathbf{k}) = i \frac{\langle u_n^L(\mathbf{k}) \vert \nabla_\mathbf{k} \vert u_n^R(\mathbf{k}) \rangle}{\langle u_n^L(\mathbf{k}) \vert u_n^R(\mathbf{k}) \rangle}
$$

Normalize so $\langle u_n^L | u_n^R \rangle = 1$ (biorthonormal). All FHS plaquette formulas below use this biorthogonal inner product.

**Pitfall:** at exceptional points (where two eigenvectors coalesce), $\langle u^L | u^R \rangle = 0$ and the connection blows up. Avoid these points by perturbing the BZ grid slightly. Numerically detect them as plaquettes with anomalously large flux.

#### 3.6.4 Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki (FHS) algorithm for Chern number

The standard discretized algorithm — quantizes the answer automatically on any grid.

```python
import numpy as np

            jp = (j + 1) % Nk2
            # 4 links around a plaquette
            U1 = np.vdot(vL[i, j, :, n_band],  vR[ip, j, :, n_band])

    # 4. Sum and quantize.
    C = np.sum(flux) / (2 * np.pi)
    return C, flux  # C should be an integer up to grid discretization error
```

**Sanity checks:**
- Sum over the full BZ → quantized integer (verify $|C - \text{round}(C)| < 0.01$ at $40 \times 40$ grid).
- $\sum_n C_n = 0$ over all bands (sum rule from $\det(M)$).
- At $\epsilon = 0$ (TR-symmetric): all $C_n = 0$ by symmetry. **If you get non-zero here, your code is buggy.**

#### 3.6.5 Wilson loop / 2D Zak phase

For the achiral case (or any TR-preserving regime), the relevant invariant is the Wilson loop (Berry phase along a 1D loop in the BZ).

For each $k_1$ on a 1D grid, compute the path-ordered product of overlap matrices along $k_2$:
$$
W(k_1) = \prod_{j=0}^{Nk_2 - 1} \langle u^L(k_1, k_2^{(j+1)}) \vert u^R(k_1, k_2^{(j)}) \rangle
$$
then the Wilson-loop phase $\theta(k_1) = \arg W(k_1)$. A non-trivial Zak phase means $\theta(k_1)$ winds by $2\pi$ as $k_1$ traverses the BZ.

```python
def wilson_phase(build_Mk, n_band, Nk1=40, Nk2=200, k1_max=2*np.pi, k2_max=2*np.pi):
    k1s = np.linspace(0, k1_max, Nk1, endpoint=False)
    k2s = np.linspace(0, k2_max, Nk2, endpoint=True)        # closed loop
    theta = np.zeros(Nk1)
    for i, k1 in enumerate(k1s):
        # Path-ordered product of <u^L(j+1) | u^R(j)> along k2
        W = 1.0 + 0j
        prev_vR = None; prev_vL = None
        for j, k2 in enumerate(k2s):
            M = build_Mk(k1, k2)
            wR, VR = eig(M); wL, VL = eig(M.conj().T)
            iR = np.argsort(wR.real); iL = np.argsort(wL.conj().real)
            vR_here = VR[:, iR[n_band]]; vL_here = VL[:, iL[n_band]]
            # Biorthonormalize
            norm = np.vdot(vL_here, vR_here)
            vR_here /= np.sqrt(norm); vL_here /= np.sqrt(norm).conj()
            if j > 0:
                W *= np.vdot(prev_vL, vR_here)
            prev_vR = vR_here; prev_vL = vL_here
        theta[i] = np.angle(W)
    return k1s, theta   # plot theta vs k1: count windings → Z_2 invariant
```

**Sanity check:** at $\epsilon = 0$ on triangular at the achiral fixed point, the Zak phase should be quantized to $0$ or $\pi$ (Z₂ topology). Non-zero ⇒ non-trivial.

#### 3.6.6 Algorithm pitfalls

1. **Band crossings inside the BZ** → can't track $n$-th band continuously by argsort. Solution: Hungarian band-matching (you already have the code in `tcrw_fig4b_paper.py`). Port it.
2. **Exceptional points** → biorthogonal norm vanishes. Detect by anomalously large plaquette flux (>> π) and avoid by grid perturbation.
3. **Choice of starting band index at degeneracy** → not unique. Solution: compute invariants over **groups of degenerate bands** (multi-band Chern), not individual bands.
4. **Grid resolution** → $40 \times 40$ usually enough for $|C| \leq 3$; bump to $80 \times 80$ if quantization is off by > 0.05.

#### 3.6.7 Reading order — pragmatic, not exhaustive

| Source | Why | Pages |
|---|---|---|
| **Asbóth, Oroszlány, Pályi, "A Short Course on Topological Insulators"** (lecture notes, 2016, free PDF) | Chapter 1 (SSH model) and 2 (Berry phase) — the cleanest intro to the Zak phase calculation | ~40 pages |
| **Vanderbilt, "Berry Phases in Electronic Structure Theory"** (CUP 2018), §3.1–§3.4 | Chern number, BZ as torus, FHS algorithm | ~50 pages |
| **Fukui, Hatsugai, Suzuki, JPSJ 74, 1674 (2005)** | Original FHS paper. 4 pages. Read once for the formula. | 4 pages |
| **Kawabata et al., PRX 9, 041015 (2019)** | Non-Hermitian topology classification. Skim. | skim only |

Skip Hasan & Kane (too long for this purpose). Skip the Bernevig book (too long).

#### 3.6.8 What "bulletproof" means for the topology calculation

You're done with the topology side when:
- [ ] Chern number computed at multiple $(\gamma, \epsilon)$ points on a $40 \times 40$ grid. Quantized to integers with error < 0.01.
- [ ] Wilson loop phase computed at $\epsilon = 0$ and shown to be 0 or π.
- [ ] At least one regime found where Chern or Zak changes — that's the topological phase transition. Plot its location in $(\gamma, \epsilon)$ space.
- [ ] Sanity checks pass: $\sum_n C_n = 0$ over all 6 bands.
- [ ] If transitions found, verify they coincide with gap closures from §3.5.

### 3.7 What we reuse from the month of TCRW reproduction work

The TCRW month was not wasted; large parts carry over directly. Here's the honest accounting:

#### Direct architectural reuse (port, don't rewrite)

| TCRW artifact | What it does | Triangular reuse |
|---|---|---|
| `tcrw_fig4b_paper.py::build_Pk` | 4×4 Bloch matrix at $\mathbf{k}$ for square TCRW | Pattern: same skeleton, swap to 6×6 with JMVR / TCRW-on-triangular coefficients. Saves ~half the boilerplate. |
| Hungarian band-matching in `tcrw_fig4b_paper.py::fig4b_band_structure` | Tracks band identity across $\mathbf{k}$ in the presence of crossings | Port verbatim to 6 bands — same algorithm, just $n=6$ instead of $n=4$. |
| `tcrw_fig4{c,d,e}.py::build_obc_matrix` | OBC matrix builder with director, site indexing, state mapping `(i,j,d) → s` | Same pattern. Triangular needs different lattice connectivity (6 NN), but the indexing logic ports. |
| `tcrw_fig4{f,g}.py::compute_edge_weight` | $\sum_{\partial}\|v\|^2$ over right eigenvectors | Reuse verbatim. The math is geometry-independent. |
| `_fig3_plot.py::_per_y_quiver` | Quiver visualization on a 1D edge | Port to triangular edge geometry. |
| Bit-identity test pattern (we used 6 test points for TCRW) | `max\|W_user − W_authors\| = 0` cross-check | **Critical for Track A.** We'll bit-check our triangular JMVR matrix against Dipanjan's `coeff_i` formulas the same way. |
| FHS Berry curvature algorithm (§3.6.4 of this plan) | Topological invariant on any 2D BZ | Universal — works on triangular BZ identically. |

#### What we do NOT carry over

- **`TRW._original_code_by_paperauthors.py`** — Osat-Speck's square-only Python. Useful as a reference for TCRW conventions but cannot be reused for triangular (their code has 4 hardcoded directors). Don't try to monkey-patch it.
- **TCRW Fortran (`tcrw_step.f90` etc.)** — TCRW is discrete-time; JMVR is continuous-time. Different walker rules. **No Fortran needed this week** anyway (eigensolve only, see §5).
- **Specific TCRW physics observables** (J_Dr / J_ω decomposition, θ angles) — JMVR has a different chirality convention; observables will be different. The decomposition machinery doesn't transfer.

#### "Help from authors" — what's available

- **Osat-Speck (TCRW authors):** they sent us `TRW.py` for square. **They did not write a triangular version.** No useful additional code to ask for; do not email again unless we hit a specific TCRW-square issue.
- **Dipanjan Mandal's `rtp_tl_2.nb`** — this IS our closest equivalent to "authors' triangular code". Already audited in §2.2. The `coeff_i` expressions are our ground-truth reference.
- **Kabir (PI)** — direct collaborator. He's an author of both JMVR and Confinement-2021 draft. Ask him in person, not by email.
- **Stephy Jose** (JMVR co-author, currently with Löwen) — copy-cc later if/when results are ready; she might be a co-author on the Track A paper given her involvement with the original draft.

#### Practical implication for week-1 plan

This reuse cuts the Day 1–2 work nearly in half. Instead of writing a 6×6 Bloch matrix from scratch, we can:

```python
# Pseudocode for Day 1 - structurally identical to tcrw_fig4b_paper.build_Pk
def build_Mk_jmvr_triangular(gamma, epsilon, k1, k2, a=1.0, b=1.0):
    """6x6 generator for triangular JMVR — matches Dipanjan's coeff_i."""
    coeff = [None] * 3
    for i, (vx, vy) in enumerate([(2*a, 0), (a, b), (a, -b)]):
        kd = vx * k1 + vy * k2
        bulk = (1/3) * (np.cos(2*a*k1) + np.cos(a*k1 + b*k2) + np.cos(a*k1 - b*k2))
        coeff[i] = bulk - 1 - gamma + 2j * epsilon * np.sin(kd)
    # Build 6x6 with γ/2 off-diagonals at (i, i±1 mod 6)
    M = np.zeros((6, 6), dtype=complex)
    M[0, 0] = coeff[0]; M[1, 1] = coeff[1]; M[2, 2] = coeff[2]
    M[3, 3] = np.conj(coeff[0]); M[4, 4] = np.conj(coeff[1]); M[5, 5] = np.conj(coeff[2])
    for i in range(6):
        M[i, (i + 1) % 6] += gamma / 2
        M[i, (i - 1) % 6] += gamma / 2
    return M
```

That's ~15 lines. Plus the diagonalization and plot infrastructure from `tcrw_fig4b_paper.py`. **Day 1 is realistically 2 hours not 3.**

## 4. Papers — reading order

### 4.1 PRIORITY 1: JMVR 2022 — Jose, Mandal, Barma, Ramola — arXiv:[2202.02995](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02995)
Confirmed citation: *"Active Random Walks in One and Two Dimensions"*, Phys. Rev. E **105**, 064103 (2022).
This is the home model. Read §II (model definition) and §III (2D square-lattice results) tonight or tomorrow morning. **Don't proceed without this read.**

### 4.2 PRIORITY 2: `rtp_tl_2.nb` (Dipanjan's Mathematica) — AUDITED 2026-05-11
Already audited (see §2.2). Structure is clear. **Two suspected bug spots: lattice anisotropy (a=b=1 not isotropic) and PBC asymmetry (kx period ≠ ky period).** Use this as a reference for the matrix structure, not as ground truth.

### 4.3 PRIORITY 3: TCRW paper (you already know it)
Re-read paper §IV (topology) — relevant when you compute Berry curvature on triangular.
**Remember: TCRW uses rotation-bias chirality, JMVR uses translation-bias chirality. Don't conflate them.**

### 4.4 BACKGROUND: Lubensky-Kane-Mao-Souslov-Sun 2015 review
*"Phonons and elasticity in critically coordinated lattices"* — Rep. Prog. Phys. **78**, 073901 (2015).
**This is NOT an active-matter review** (corrected from earlier draft of this plan). It's the foundational review on **topological mechanics and Maxwell rigidity** — isostatic lattices, floppy modes, topological zero modes in mechanical metamaterials. The connection to your work is via topology, not via active matter directly. Useful if/when you read about topological mechanics (Kane–Lubensky line); skip for the JMVR triangular calculation itself.

### 4.5 LATER: Dolai_single_file_active_2020
*"Universal scaling in active single-file dynamics"* — multi-particle, single-file. Reference for the multi-particle direction PI mentioned. Not now.

### 4.6 LATER: Confinement_enhanced_clustering
Multi-particle paper. Same — defer.

### 4.7 LATER: Odd elasticity (Scheibner-Cohen-Vitelli)
Not sent but mentioned. Find it: "Scheibner Cohen Vitelli odd elasticity Nature Physics 2020". For when you do multi-particle.

## 5. The work — driven by physics, not by deadlines

**Revised 2026-05-11 evening.** Previous version of this section had a day-by-day schedule. Dropped. Research isn't a sprint; it's a sequence of physics questions. Each step is "what does the physics ask next", not "what's tomorrow's deliverable".

### Where we are right now

- 6×6 generator $M(\mathbf{k})$ built in `triangular_jmvr_v1.py`.
- Bit-identical to Dipanjan's `coeff_i` at a random test point.
- Eigenvalues at $\mathbf{k}=0$ (for $\gamma=0.01$): $\{0,\ -\gamma/2,\ -\gamma/2,\ -3\gamma/2,\ -3\gamma/2,\ -2\gamma\}$ — Perron eigenvalue $\lambda_0 = 0$ confirms a stationary state exists.
- At $\epsilon=0$ the spectrum is real; at $\epsilon=0.15$ it picks up imaginary parts. Non-Hermitian topology activates with chirality.
- Band-structure plot exists but band identity is scrambled by argsort sorting — fix needed.

### What the physics demands next, in logical order

Move to the next step only when the previous one's answer is solid. No time budget on any of them.

**Step 1 — Make the band structure actually visible.** Hungarian band-matching from `tcrw_fig4b_paper.py::fig4b_band_structure` ports directly to 6 bands. Until this is done, we cannot answer "is there a gap?" — the current plot literally has the bands relabeled at every crossing. Prerequisite for everything below.

**Step 2 — Compute the BZ path properly.** Use the reciprocal lattice $\mathbf{b}_1, \mathbf{b}_2$ from $\mathbf{a}_1 = (2, 0), \mathbf{a}_2 = (1, 1)$ (Dipanjan's convention) and find the exact $\Gamma, M, K$. Until this is right, features at the corners might be sampling artefacts and aren't trustworthy.

**Step 3 — Look at the cleaned bands. Is there a gap? At what $(\gamma, \epsilon)$?** This is the first real physics result. Scan $\epsilon$ at fixed $\gamma$, plot minimum gap. Three outcomes are equally interesting:
- Gap closes at some $\epsilon^* > 0$ → phase transition. Map its location.
- Gap stays open for all $\epsilon \in [0, 1/6]$ → JMVR triangular is topologically trivial in this sense; topology question moves to Track B (TCRW-style).
- Gap closes at one or more isolated $\mathbf{k}$ points only (Dirac-like) → richer story, look for monopoles in Berry curvature.

**Step 4 — Compute $P(\mathbf{r}, t)$ for a single walker.** This is the missing §IV.B of the Confinement draft. Inverse Fourier of $\tilde{P}(\mathbf{k}, t) = \sum_n c_n \mathbf{v}_n^R e^{\lambda_n t}$ over a finite BZ grid. Plot at late times. Look for the chirality signature (petal-like asymmetry similar to draft's Fig 7 for square).

**Step 5 — Multi-walker $P(\mathbf{r}, t)$ with step initial condition.** The §V hole of the draft. The 1D analog (draft Fig 2d) shows non-monotonic clustering in number of walkers $W$. Does that survive on triangular? Answer that and §V is filled.

**Step 6 — Topological invariants (Berry curvature, Wilson loops).** Only meaningful once Step 3 gives a non-trivial gap structure. FHS algorithm from §3.6.4. If JMVR turns out trivial, this step pivots to Track B (TCRW-style chirality on triangular).

**Step 7 — PBC bug hunt and real-space verification.** Build the real-space transition matrix on a finite triangular lattice. Compare its discrete spectrum to the Bloch eigenvalues at quantized $\mathbf{k}$-points. Any mismatch → that's the bug Kabir mentioned. This is also the foundation for edge-current calculations in OBC.

### What's deliberately NOT in this sequence

- **Monte Carlo Fortran.** The eigenvalue calculation IS the result for everything in Steps 1–6. MC would only be needed if we want to verify Step 7 with a finite-time walker simulation, and even there, kinetic Monte Carlo in Python is simpler.
- **TCRW-style chirality on triangular** (Track B). Only after Steps 1–5 give a clean JMVR picture. If Step 6 shows JMVR is topologically trivial, that's when Track B becomes the active path.
- **Multi-particle interactions, odd elasticity, topological mechanics.** PI's longer-term direction. Reading material for after the JMVR triangular calculation is done.

### Sanity instinct — what to do at each step before moving on

Look at the result. Spend a few minutes. Ask:
- Does it make physical sense at the limits ($\epsilon = 0$ should give isotropic spreading; $\gamma \to 0$ should approach ballistic motion in each director)?
- Does it match what you'd guess from the square version?
- Does it match Dipanjan's Mathematica where it can?

If something looks off, stop and investigate. **30 minutes of "wait, this doesn't add up" investigation is worth 3 hours of building on a wrong foundation.**

### When to talk to PI

When there's something concrete to say, not on a calendar. Likely natural moments:
- After Step 3: "Sir, here's the band structure on triangular. The gap [closes at ε=? / stays open]. Compared to square TCRW where it closes at ω=1/2, this is [the same / different]."
- After Step 4: "Sir, here's the §IV.B figure for the Confinement draft — single walker on triangular. The chirality shows up as ___."
- After Step 6: "Sir, the Chern number / Wilson phase is ___ in the regime ε > ε*."
- After Step 7: "Sir, found the PBC issue Dipanjan had — it was ___."

PI doesn't want weekly progress updates. He wants research answers. Don't artificially fragment them.

## 6. Open questions

### Resolved 2026-05-11

1. ~~JMVR paper citation~~ — **RESOLVED.** Jose, Mandal, **Barma**, Ramola, Phys. Rev. E **105**, 064103 (2022), arXiv:[2202.02995](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02995). Note: it's **Barma**, not Verma, as Kabir said.
2. ~~Mathematica access~~ — **RESOLVED.** Don't need Mathematica installed; the .nb file structure was extracted via sandbox `grep` (it's plain XML-ish text). Structure is documented in §2.2.
3. ~~Timeline~~ — **RESOLVED.** Soft Friday deadline (2026-05-15) for first band-structure plot.
4. ~~Edge geometry~~ — **PROVISIONALLY RESOLVED.** Start with rhombus (simpler). Hexagon if time permits.

### Still open (ask Kabir when convenient, or proceed with default)

5. **"γ/2_A vs γ/2_B" in PI's handwritten notes** — best guess: PI was using approximate shorthand for the forward/backward translation rates ($\frac{1}{6} + \epsilon$ vs $\frac{1}{6} - \epsilon$ in the triangular case, or $\frac{1}{2} \pm \epsilon$ in 1D). The "γ/2" was probably mis-named — the actual rotation rate γ doesn't enter the translation rates. Default: use 1/6 ± ε for triangular forward/backward bias.
6. **Lattice parametrization** — Dipanjan used $a = b = 1$ which gives Cartesian NN lengths $(2, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})$. **Corrected (2026-05-11): this is a deliberate parametrization choice, not a bug.** The Confinement draft Fig 1 uses these exact coordinates. Topologically equivalent to true 60°-isotropic ($\mathbf{a}_1 = (1, 0)$, $\mathbf{a}_2 = (1/2, \sqrt{3}/2)$). Either works; pick one and stick with it. Recommend: **use Dipanjan's $(2a, 0), (a, b), (a, -b)$ convention** so the matrix structure literally matches the draft's equations. Easier for cross-checking.
7. **Anshuman's contact** — Anshuman Pandey? Anshuman Kumar? Don't know. **Plan:** ask Kabir or the group's mailing list for contact. Useful for PBC code reference but not blocking.
8. **Which chirality convention to do FIRST** — JMVR-style (translation bias) is now the primary track (Track A). TCRW-style (rotation bias) is Track B, secondary.
9. **Where is the PBC bug Kabir mentioned?** — Not in the Bloch matrix (which looks self-consistent). Must be in Dipanjan's real-space implementation (which we haven't extracted from the `.nb` yet). **Plan:** once we have a working Bloch implementation, build the real-space PBC matrix on a small grid and compare back to the eigenvalue structure of the Bloch matrix at the discrete k-points. Any mismatch → that's the PBC bug.

---

## 7. The publishable angle (if it works)

**Corrected framing (2026-05-11 review):** JMVR is **exact stochastic stat-mech** (occupation probabilities, large-deviation function), NOT topology. TCRW is the topological-edge-current paper. Don't conflate them.

Two distinct possible papers come out of this work — pursue whichever Track succeeds:

### Track A paper — Complete the Confinement 2021 draft
**Title:** *Active random walks on a triangular lattice* (or extend the Confinement 2021 working title).

**Abstract sketch:**
1. Mandal-Barma-Ramola 2021 (unpublished draft) studied confinement-enhanced clustering for active random walkers in 1D and on the 2D square lattice. The 2D triangular case was sketched but never completed.
2. We fill in §IV.B (single walker, triangular) and §V (multi-walker clustering, triangular) of that draft.
3. Closed-form (or numerically computed) occupation distribution $P(\mathbf{r}, t)$ on triangular for chirality $\epsilon \in [0, 1/6]$.
4. Verify the non-monotonic clustering signature (1D Fig 2(d) of the draft) survives 6-fold geometry.
5. Connect to JMVR 2022 (the published square-lattice version) and discuss the role of lattice symmetry.

This is the **natural completion** of an existing draft. Authors would likely include Mandal, Barma, Ramola, and you. **Probability of becoming a paper: high**, since it finishes work the group already started.

### Track B paper — Triangular topology
**Title:** *Topological edge currents of a chiral random walker on a triangular lattice* (only if you pursue TCRW-style chirality on triangular and find non-trivial topology).

**Abstract sketch:**
1. The Osat-Speck 2026 TCRW model has non-trivial 2D-Zak-phase topology on the square lattice; gap closes at $\omega = 1/2$.
2. We extend to 6-fold triangular geometry with rotation-bias chirality.
3. Result: [the topology survives / shifts / a new invariant appears].
4. Edge modes confirmed in OBC.

Probability of becoming a paper: **conditional** on the topology turning out non-trivial in a different way than square. If identical, it's just a robustness note.

**Track A is the safer bet.** It's an in-group continuation of established work. Track B is a riskier research bet but a more original contribution if the topology genuinely differs.

The Dipanjan-2019 work being incomplete + the JMVR paper being the home stat-mech reference + the Confinement 2021 draft being unfinished + PI's own admission that he doesn't know the topology question = **this is genuinely open territory, not a textbook exercise.**

---

## 8. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| PBC implementation gets wrong | Use lattice coordinates everywhere; verify by checking the achiral limit gives the JMVR result | 
| 6×6 matrix has degeneracies that complicate band tracking | Use Hungarian band-matching algo (already implemented in TCRW Fig 4(b)) — port the same logic |
| Berry curvature is numerically ill-defined at band crossings | Track the lowest-band invariant only; use Fukui-Hatsugai discretization |
| Triangular case gives identical physics to square — less interesting | Pivot to multi-particle (Task 3) earlier than planned |
| Mathematica file has more bugs than expected — uses for reference only | Don't trust Dipanjan's code blindly; verify everything from scratch in Python |

---

## 9. Bottom line

This is **a real research project**, not a reproduction exercise. PI's framing is:
- *Test*: can you generalize a model competently?
- *Research*: does the topology survive 4-fold → 6-fold?
- *Group strategic*: pick up a 5-year-old abandoned thread and bring it to closure.

The triangular extension is the right next step from the TCRW reproduction. If it goes well, this can be a paper with you as first author within ~6 months. The multi-particle direction (Task 3) is a 1–2 year project after this.
